# Dscord2

Yet another Discord API wrapper, but less ironically.

## Purpose

Solely for me to learn how REST API works.
It was never actively maintained, since ~~I am lazy, and~~ I've achieved my objective... or did I?

## Installation

    pip install git+https://github.com/thisgary/Dscord2

## Feature

`dscord.Request` - Perform requests with Discord API.

`dscord.Websocket` - Establish connection with Discord Gateway API.
